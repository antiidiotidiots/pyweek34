# Stranded

## The game:
You're flying through space, and suddenly your course changes. Red lights are flashing everywhere, and suddenly… You’re on an unknown planet, with little information on how to escape. You have limited oxygen and food… Can you escape this hostile environment?  
  
Stranded is a game we made for the PyWeek 34 game jam in 1 week.  
Unfortunately, we didn't get to implement everything we wanted to, although we did try.

## Running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
`python run_game.py`  
  
### Linux:
Before running, you may have to install some packages depending on your distro. I can't quite say what you may need because I can't consistently reproduce the errors, so just look up the error you get if you see any.
